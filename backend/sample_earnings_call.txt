ACME CORPORATION Q4 2023 EARNINGS CALL TRANSCRIPT

MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION

CEO John Smith:
Good morning everyone. We're pleased to report strong results for Q4 2023. Revenue grew 15% year-over-year, driven by robust demand in our core markets. We're seeing excellent momentum across all business segments.

Our operating margins improved to 20.5%, up from 19.2% last year. This reflects our operational efficiency initiatives and favorable product mix. We're very optimistic about our growth trajectory.

CFO Sarah Johnson:
Thank you, John. Net profit for the quarter was $178.4 million, up 14% from Q4 2022. Our balance sheet remains strong with $450 million in cash.

Looking ahead to 2024, we're providing guidance of 10-12% revenue growth and operating margin expansion of 50-100 basis points. We're confident in achieving these targets.

However, we are monitoring some headwinds. Supply chain challenges persist, particularly for semiconductor components. Raw material costs have increased by approximately 8% since last quarter. These are areas of concern that we're actively managing.

CEO John Smith:
On growth initiatives, we're excited about three key areas:

First, our expansion into the Asian markets is progressing well. We opened two new facilities in Vietnam and plan to add three more in 2024.

Second, we're investing heavily in R&D for our next-generation product line, which we expect to launch in Q3 2024. Early customer feedback has been extremely positive.

Third, we're pursuing strategic acquisitions to complement our organic growth. We have a strong pipeline and expect to announce something in the first half of 2024.

Regarding capacity utilization, we're currently operating at 85% across our manufacturing facilities, up from 78% a year ago. We're increasing capacity utilization steadily to meet growing demand.
